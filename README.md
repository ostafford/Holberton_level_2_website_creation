# JS Notes

Notes (Concept understanding)

1. Create a variableName `let variableName =`
2. Select the element (`document.getElementById("name_of_ID")`);
3. Add an eventListener (`variableName.addEventListener("type");`)
   i. `type` = What is it that you're listening for (eg. click)
4. create the function (`function (){};`)
5. `if` statement.
   i. if variableName.property is equal to an empty string(""). If true (`==`) it means the variable has no property so execute the code
   ii. In plain English: "If the property is empty (i.e., the image is big), add the class "small" to shrink the image."
6. `else` statement
   i. this would indicate that the `if` statement would be false so execute the last bit of the function code.
