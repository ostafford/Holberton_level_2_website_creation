              From Perth to Pedals: <br />
              Melbourne's Cycling Scene
            </h2>
            <div class="content_panel">
              <p>
                When I landed in Melbourne on the 15th of March, 2015, all I had
                with me were my two track bikes, a suitcase full of clothes, and
                a backpack. It wasn’t much, but it was enough. After settling in
                at a family friend’s place, I immediately got to work assembling
                one of my bikes, eager to explore the city.
              </p>
              <p>
                It didn’t take long to realize Melbourne was a cycling paradise.
                The rules were new, though—hook turns and tram lanes were
                foreign concepts back in Perth. But once I adjusted, the city
                felt like home. A few weeks later, I found myself living in a
                small studio apartment on Spencer Street, right in the heart of
                the CBD, cycling to my job at Apple at Highpoint Shopping Centre
                every day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through work, I met Adrian Ley, a fellow cyclist and founder of
                Soup Boys, a cycling crew known for mixing adventure and riding.
                We clicked instantly, bonding over our shared love for riding.
                Soon, Adrian invited me to join his local group rides, and
                before I knew it, I was deep in Melbourne's cycling community.

              <p>
                Living in Perth, I was a solo rider. It was just me, my bike,
                and the road. But Melbourne was different. The cycling scene
                here was vibrant, and it wasn’t long before I found myself at my
                first Australian Road Nationals up in Buninyong. The atmosphere
                was electric. Crowds roared as the riders zipped by, cowbells
                clanged in celebration, and the hum of spinning cassettes filled
                the air. It was a spectacle like no other. I was hooked.
              </p>
              <p>
                That experience pushed me to dive into track racing, both indoor
                and outdoor. I remember my first time at the DISC Velodrome in
                Thornbury—learning how to keep the bike upright, never stopping
                pedaling, and gaining the kind of confidence only a few crashes
                can teach. After all, are you really a cyclist if you haven’t
                hit the deck?

              Winter Solstice's: A cold, crazy tradition
            </h2>
            <div class="content_panel">
              <p>
                One of the most memorable experiences I’ve had since moving to
                Melbourne was joining the WNTRSLTC (Winter Solstice). I had no
                idea what to expect when Adrian invited me to the event, but I
                said yes without hesitation. I quickly learned what it meant:
                riding the most kilometers in the shortest amount of sunlight,
                all during the coldest day of the year.
              </p>
              <p>
                The temperature? -4 degrees. The location? Somewhere deep in
                regional Victoria. The experience? Unforgettable. Every year
                something goes wrong—a mechanical failure, someone taking a
                wrong turn—but what never falters is the energy and camaraderie
                of the riders. It’s a true test of endurance, but the vibe
                always makes it worth it.

                No story of my cycling journey would be complete without
                mentioning my trusty riding partner, Willow. She’s our
                3-year-old border collie, and she loves nothing more than
                cruising down Beach Road with me. As you might expect, she gets
                plenty of attention—cars pulling over to take photos, people
                smiling and waving. Seeing the joy she brings to others is the
                best part of our rides. It’s not just me that feels the thrill
                of cycling; it’s Willow too, and everyone we pass along the way.
