        <h2>
          From Perth to Pedals: My Journey Through Melbourne's Cycling Scene
        </h2>
        <p>
          When I landed in Melbourne on the 15th of March, 2015, all I had with
          me were my two track bikes, a suitcase full of clothes, and a
          backpack. It wasn’t much, but it was enough. After settling in at a
          family friend’s place, I immediately got to work assembling one of my
          bikes, eager to explore the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          It didn’t take long to realize Melbourne was a cycling paradise. The
          rules were new, though—hook turns and tram lanes were foreign concepts
          back in Perth. But once I adjusted, the city felt like home. A few
          weeks later, I found myself living in a small studio apartment on
          Spencer Street, right in the heart of the CBD, cycling to my job at
          Apple at Highpoint Shopping Centre every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through work, I met Adrian Ley, a fellow cyclist and founder of Soup
          Boys, a cycling crew known for mixing adventure and riding. We clicked
          instantly, bonding over our shared love for riding. Soon, Adrian
          invited me to join his local group rides, and before I knew it, I was
          deep in Melbourne's cycling community.

        <h2>Fast Forward to 2016: My First Road Nationals</h2>
        <p>
          Living in Perth, I was a solo rider. It was just me, my bike, and the
          road. But Melbourne was different. The cycling scene here was vibrant,
          and it wasn’t long before I found myself at my first Australian Road
          Nationals up in Buninyong. The atmosphere was electric. Crowds roared
          as the riders zipped by, cowbells clanged in celebration, and the hum
          of spinning cassettes filled the air. It was a spectacle like no
          other. I was hooked.
        </p>
        <p>
          That experience pushed me to dive into track racing, both indoor and
          outdoor. I remember my first time at the DISC Velodrome in
          Thornbury—learning how to keep the bike upright, never stopping
          pedaling, and gaining the kind of confidence only a few crashes can
          teach. After all, are you really a cyclist if you haven’t hit the
          deck?

        <h2>The Winter Solstice Ride: A Cold, crazy Tradition</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most memorable experiences I’ve had since moving to
          Melbourne was joining the WNTRSLTC (Winter Solstice). I had no idea
          what to expect when Adrian invited me to the event, but I said yes
          without hesitation. I quickly learned what it meant: riding the most
          kilometers in the shortest amount of sunlight, all during the coldest
          day of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The temperature? -4 degrees. The location? Somewhere deep in regional
          Victoria. The experience? Unforgettable. Every year something goes
          wrong—a mechanical failure, someone taking a wrong turn—but what never
          falters is the energy and camaraderie of the riders. It’s a true test
          of endurance, but the vibe always makes it worth it.
        </p>

        <h2>Introducing Willow: My Speedy Sidekick</h2>
        <p>
          No story of my cycling journey would be complete without mentioning my
          trusty riding partner, Willow. She’s my 3-year-old border collie, and
          she loves nothing more than cruising down Beach Road with me. As you
          might expect, she gets plenty of attention—cars pulling over to take
          photos, people smiling and waving. Seeing the joy she brings to others
          is the best part of our rides. It’s not just me that feels the thrill
          of cycling; it’s Willow too, and everyone we pass along the way.
