        <h2>2017: A Year of Setbacks and Rediscovery</h2>
        <p>
          2017 wasn’t my ideal year. For the first time in my life, I was hit by
          a car—T-boned while cycling. It’s an experience I’ll never forget. The
          lengthy recovery off the bike took a toll on both my physical and
          mental health. Being away from riding felt like a huge loss. But
          during that time, I reflected deeply and decided I wasn’t ready to
          give up. Instead, I reconnected with another passion of mine—Muay
          Thai.
        </p>
        <p>
          My Muay Thai journey started back in Perth in 2004. I trained 5-6 days
          a week, going straight to the gym after school or work. Through
          countless repetitions and years of dedication, I started to grasp the
          bigger lessons in life—what truly mattered and what didn’t. I won’t
          bore you with the deep philosophy, but Muay Thai taught me discipline,
          resilience, and self-awareness. By 2010, I was coaching juniors and
          young adults at just 19 years old. With nearly six years of experience
          under my belt, I felt a sense of duty to give back to the community. I
          became a full-time coach after work, helping to nurture a new
          generation of fighters.

          Over the years, the gym I coached at crowned state champions and even
          world titleholders. Under the guidance of my head coach, Phon Martdee,
          I took pride in being part of their journey. Eventually, I extended my
          support to family friends of Phon, Tip, and Rob, who opened a gym in
          O’Connor. They asked me to be the head instructor, and while there’s
          an unwritten code in Muay Thai that fighters and coaches usually stay
          with one gym, our bond of friendship and mutual respect made the
          transition smooth.

          The gym flourished, and we built a strong reputation. But in 2015, my
          journey led me to Melbourne. It was an emotional departure—I had no
          idea what lay ahead, especially in terms of Melbourne’s Muay Thai
          scene. Around that time, the UFC and MMA were starting to boom, and
          Muay Thai wasn’t as prominent as it had been back in Perth.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the crash and during my recovery, a friend introduced me to "The
          Ring Gym." When I met the head coach, Andy Colgrave, I felt an
          immediate connection. The gym’s atmosphere reminded me of Sangmorakot,
          the gym I had left behind in Perth. It turned out that I had watched
          Andy fight years ago at one of Phon’s shows. I offered to help out at
          The Ring, holding pads for anyone who needed support, just as I had
          done back in Perth—no payment, just me giving back to the community.

          What started as a simple offer of help turned into something much
          bigger. Days turned into months, and months into years. The Ring Gym
          has become more than just a place to train—it’s a community. From kids
          to young adults, women to men, the encouragement and support everyone
          gives one another have been exactly what I needed.
        </p>

          Muay Thai has been an incredible journey for me, and I hope to
          continue it for as long as possible.
