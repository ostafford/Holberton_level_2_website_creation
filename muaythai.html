              <p>
                My Muay Thai journey started back in Perth in 2004. I trained
                5-6 days a week, going straight to the gym after school or work.
                Through countless repetitions and years of dedication, I started
                to grasp the bigger lessons in life—what truly mattered and what
                didn’t. I won’t bore you with the deep philosophy, but Muay Thai
                taught me discipline, resilience, and self-awareness. By 2010, I
                was coaching juniors and young adults at just 19 years old. With
                nearly six years of experience under my belt, I felt a sense of
                duty to give back to the community. I became a full-time coach
                after work, helping to nurture a new generation of fighters.

                Over the years, the gym I coached at crowned state champions and
                even world titleholders. Under the guidance of my head coach,
                Phon Martdee, I took pride in being part of their journey.
                Eventually, I extended my support to family friends of Phon,
                Tip, and Rob, who opened a gym in O’Connor. They asked me to be
                the head instructor, and while there’s an unwritten code in Muay
                Thai that fighters and coaches usually stay with one gym, our
                bond of friendship and mutual respect made the transition
                smooth.
              </p>
              <p>
                The gym flourished, and we built a strong reputation. But in
                2015, my journey led me to Melbourne. It was an emotional
                departure—I had no idea what lay ahead, especially in terms of
                Melbourne’s Muay Thai scene. Around that time, the UFC and MMA
                were starting to boom, and Muay Thai wasn’t as prominent as it
                had been back in Perth.

              <p>
                2017 wasn’t my ideal year. For the first time in my life, I was
                hit by a car—T-boned while cycling. It’s an experience I’ll
                never forget. The lengthy recovery off the bike took a toll on
                both my physical and mental health. Being away from riding felt
                like a huge loss. But during that time, I reflected deeply and
                decided I wasn’t ready to give up. Instead, I reconnected with
                another passion of mine—Muay Thai.

            <div class="content_panel">
              <p>
                After the crash and during my recovery, a friend introduced me
                to "The Ring Gym." When I met the head coach, Andy Colgrave, I
                felt an immediate connection. The gym’s atmosphere reminded me
                of Sangmorakot, the gym I had left behind in Perth. It turned
                out that I had watched Andy fight years ago at one of Phon’s
                shows. I offered to help out at The Ring, holding pads for
                anyone who needed support, just as I had done back in Perth—no
                payment, just me giving back to the community.

                What started as a simple offer of help turned into something
                much bigger. Days turned into months, and months into years. The
                Ring Gym has become more than just a place to train—it’s a
                community. From kids to young adults, women to men, the
                encouragement and support everyone gives one another have been
                exactly what I needed.

                Muay Thai has been an incredible journey for me, and I hope to
                continue it for as long as possible.
